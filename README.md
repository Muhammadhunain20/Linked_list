# Linked List Operations in C++

This C++ project demonstrates basic operations on a singly linked list, including insertion, deletion, traversal, and search.

## Overview
The project implements a singly linked list structure with the following operations:

### Insertion
1. **Insert at the Beginning:** Insert a new element at the beginning of the list.
2. **Insert at any Point:** Insert a new element at any specified position in the list.

### Deletion
3. **Delete at the Beginning:** Delete the first element of the list.
4. **Delete at any Point:** Delete an element at any specified position in the list.

### Other Operations
5. **Traversal:** Display all elements of the linked list.
6. **Search:** Search for an element in the list.

## Getting Started
1. Download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
4. Run the executable.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform linked list operations.

## Usage
- The program provides a simple command-line interface to interact with linked list operations.
- Choose the operation by entering the corresponding number and follow the prompts.
